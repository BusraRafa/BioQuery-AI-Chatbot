How are you doing, brother? Salaam! I don't know if you remember me from our last conversation. 

we want to catch up with you about the update of your server set up.as you have share us your goal to make a super app for the users and also engaging the plumbers for emergencies which is really appreciable you know in here we don't have this approach yet so this is really innovative start. and to make a server for the security of the users it's really a big investment and a appreciable big step in the technology world. i hope you have considered all the set up and the time process for this server build up

What’s the status of the server setup? How far along is the process? You wanted to set up your own server for yourself, so we wanted to get an update. I know it’s a big investment, and it will take a lot of time. Setting up a server is not easy task, have you considered which system gpu to buy 


it's like building a foundation for a building. You need a strong base to ensure good service and it needs to be maintained properly daily year after year. Also, it needs to be built in such a way that it can handle various malicious attacks with encryption to keep your data safe, as this is one of your main concerns, and to protect access to your models and systems.

Have you done this?


--------have you consider which machine to buy first 
measure the traffic of users first before taking the hardware. Since your goal is to make it global, it's important to understand user traffic first and then make a big investment.





It will really take a lot of time, and it has to be done with great technicians and guidance with patience.

(it is best to take time to setup the machine with good foundation , like a building. but meanwhile as we are working on backend integration of this project we would need something to test this phase so that we can present the outcome of the project so that we can be on track you know
parallelly you can set up the server with strong base and have the good server and secure the users trust core)

If you go with this server setup, which includes purchasing hardware, setting up the hardware, installing it, creating a room, securing the server, app integration, testing, and monitoring, it would be better if you measure the traffic of users first before taking the hardware. Since your goal is to make it global, it's important to understand user traffic first and then make a big investment.

I don’t want you to rush into this because it’s a lifetime investment. I really like your idea, and I want this app to go live and be used effectively by people, becoming global. But you know the saying, 'Look before you leap.' It will be better if you take your time to set up the hardware investment and do it smoothly because, as you know, it's a physical machine, not like a virtual machine.

A VPS (Virtual Private Server) could also give you the same output with instant connection settings without any time delay, but with data encryption as well.

So, my suggestion would be to initially buy a VPS server, and we can suggest an initial GPU version for testing. We test it, and after integration, you can also test it. Based on the user traffic, you can adjust the GPU version—either bigger or smaller—according to the traffic. This way, you get your return on the app, and after analyzing the user traffic, you can invest in the hardware accordingly."
